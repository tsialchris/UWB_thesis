# Glossy Test - A simple application to evaluate Glossy

Glossy Test allows evaluation of the Glossy implementation for the DW1000
built for the Contiki OS.


## `glossy_test` process

The program accounts for two types of nodes:

* the flood initiator
* receivers

Once the process starts, it checks whether the device is the
initiator.

* If it is not, it waits some time `Tr` and then it
  goes to the `glossy_thread`.

* If it is, the device waits a time `Ti`, `Ti > Tr`, to be
  sure receivers are booted, after which it continues to
  the `glossy_thread`.

Within `glossy_thread` a receiver keeps scanning the channel until 
receiving a packet from the initiator, after which it can synchronise 
to it and schedule synchronised listening phases.

An initiator instead, issues a Glossy session to flood a packet
identified by a sequence number. When the flood ends, the node
waits until the next period before transmitting a new packet.


## Configuration and compilation

Currently, the implementation of Glossy for DW1000 only supports the
EVB1000 platform. We are working to enable it on the DWM1001 as well.

It is possible to tune both Glossy and the application.
The application parameters can be configured directly
in the `glossy_test.c` file and comprise:

* the *Period*, the time between two consecutive Glossy floods
  issued by the initiator,
* the *Slot* duration, the time after which a Glossy flood is **forced**
  to stop in case it hasn't already,
* the *Guard* time, the time used as offset for receivers to start
  listening before the expected flood start time, once the receiver
  is synchronised with the initiator,

Configurations for the Glossy protocol itself can be set
in the `project-conf.h`, a list with the possible values can
be found in the `project-conf-template.h`.

Parameters include:

* *N_TX* the maximum number of transmissions, within a Glossy flood
  after which the communication is considered complete and the Glossy 
  round ends.


* the *Glossy Version* used, in which:

    1. `Glossy Standard` denotes the original version of the protocol,
       in which the communication pattern for a receiver within a flood
       is such that a transmission follows each and every reception;

    2. `Glossy TX only` denotes the version in which a receiver, after
       the first reception, performs only transmissions.

* the *Slot estimation approach* to use, which can be:

    1. `Dynamic`, in which the slot is computed as the sum of the
        times between the reception and transmission or
        transmission and reception of two packets with consecutive
        relay counters and the total number of such pairs encountered.

    2. `Static`, in which the slot is estimated based on the length
        of the frame received.

* whether to use the dw1000 *Smart Tx Power* feature (default to No).

* the payload length to be used within the application (default to 115).

In case no settings are defined related to Glossy in the `project-conf.h`
file, the protocol will use the *TX only Version* with *Static Slot Estimation* as default values.

### `project-conf.h` â€“ main configuration file

The project comes with no `project-conf.h` file. This is
to allow the `simgen.py` script generate it. This also means that radio
configurations stated in `radio-conf.h` **ARE NOT TAKEN
INTO ACCOUNT** by default, since this header is supposed to be included 
in the `project-conf.h` file.

If you want to manually compile the test, you can copy
the `project-conf-template.h` file to `project-conf.h`,
define Glossy parameters to your liking and compile the
project issuing the make command.

### Radio configuration

Within the `radio-conf.h` file, communication parameters
for the DW1000 radio chip are defined.
As mentioned previously, if no `project-conf.h` is employed, the
radio configuration is set to the default values of Contiki-UWB, 
so it should somehow work. You can always check the radio configuration
employed by looking at the log the nodes produce. They print the radio
configuration at boot.

Note that we have only tested Glossy with the datarate of 6.8 Mbps
and the preamble length of up to 128.


### `simgen.py` - Generating test batches

To make it easier to generate batches of tests, 
the `simgen.py` program present
in the `test_tools` folder might be used.

Check out its README to know more on its usage.
It generates a number of test binaries for the
set of configuration parameters specified in the
`params.py` file. It also produces test descriptors
required by the testbed we use at the University of
Trento, but the same script might be useful even with
other testbeds.

### Node ID mapping
To use the application you should provide MAC address to Node ID mapping
as described in the `../deployment/README.md` file.
