 * the driver sets a compare value that is behind. In this case, if the

 * However, to detect if the requested value is behind, this mode makes the
 * following assumptions: 
 * -  The maximum preemption time in ticks (8-bit value)
 *    is known and is less than 7.7 ms (for prescaler = 0, RTC frequency 32 kHz).
 * -  The requested absolute compare value is not bigger than
